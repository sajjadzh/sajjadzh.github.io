      "A literature review on the two-phase flow inside plain tubes, especially for the refrigerant R1234yf, is conducted in this research. The flow boiling, condensation, and visualization of this low GWP refrigerant were examined experimentally to measure the heat transfer coefficients and pressure drop of the refrigerant, and also to present a flow pattern map. The measurements were carried out on smooth circular tubes with internal diameters of 8.2 mm for the mass velocity ranging from 95 to 410 kg m−2 s−1, vapor qualities from 0.12 to 0.92, and saturation temperatures from 26.3°C to 33.5°C. For the range of test parameters, the flow patterns were observed and compared with the work of Wojtan et al. Also, the experimental results were analyzed to evaluate the effect of mass flow and vapor quality. Generally, both parameters increase the heat transfer and pressure drop in the boiling and condensing flows. Also, the experimental results were compared with the existing models proposed to predict the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop. Two correlations, based on the previous studies, were proposed to improve the accuracy of the heat transfer coefficient prediction. the correlation of Dobson et al. was adapted and resulted in a mean absolute error of 11.9%. Also, the Liu and Winterton model for boiling was modified to reduce its mean absolute error from 25.6% to 13.4%",

    abstract:
      "The condensing flow of R1234yf in a smooth horizontal helically coiled tube is studied experimentally to achieve the heat transfer coefficient and frictional pressure gradient. The helical coil diameter is 95.3 mm with a constant pitch of 16.7 mm and is made by coiling a flexible smooth tube with an internal diameter of 8.2 mm. The effect of vapor quality, mass velocity and saturation temperature on the two-phase heat transfer coefficient and frictional pressure gradient are investigated. The experiments are carried out at saturation temperatures of 20 °C and 30 °C for the mass velocity ranging from 95 kg m−2 s−1 to 285 kg m−2 s−1 and vapor quality from 0.1 to 0.8. In addition, the experimental results of the helically coiled tube are compared with those achieved for a straight smooth tube at the same operating conditions to evaluate the effect of coiling on the condensation heat transfer and frictional pressure gradient. The results suggest that the average heat transfer coefficients of the helically coiled tube are 60–120% higher than those of the straight tubes with the penalty of 46–108% for the frictional pressure gradient. Considering both thermal and hydraulic performances, the Performance Evaluation Criteria (PEC) is defined. The values of PEC are varied between 0.91 and 1.52 while the highest PECs are observed for the intermediate mass velocity of 190 kg m−2 s−1. New correlations to estimate the heat transfer coefficient and frictional pressure gradient are suggested based on the experimental results of the current study.",

      "In this study, the boiling flow of R1234yf inside flattened tubes is experimentally investigated to determine the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop. The experiments were carried out on a round tube of 8.2 inner diameter and three flattened tubes with internal heights of 6.2, 5.1 and 2.8 (aspect ratios of 1.5, 2, and 4), with mass velocities between 110 and 410 kg/m2s, and vapor qualities between 0.1 and 0.9. The experimental data were analyzed to determine the effect of vapor quality, mass velocity, and flattening the tubes on the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop. Also, the performance evaluation criterion (PEC) was used to investigate the effect of flattening on the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop simultaneously. The results showed that for the flattened tubes with 1.5, 2, and 4 aspect ratios, the heat transfer coefficient enhances up to 53%, 99%, and 154%; while the pressure drop increases up to 54%, 167%, and 270%, respectively, compared to those of the round tube. In addition, according to the results, the enhancement factor increases with the aspect ratio, and the tube with the aspect ratio of 2 showed the highest PEC at high mass velocities.",

      "The present study investigates the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop of refrigerant R1234yf condensing flow in flattened tubes. Three tubes with internal heights of 6.2, 5.1 and 2.8 mm (aspect ratios of 1.5, 2 and 4), made by flattening 8.2 mm inner diameter round tubes, were used. The tests were conducted at a mass velocity range of 95–380 kg m−2 s−1 and vapor quality range of 0.15–0.8. The effects of tubes flattening, mass velocity and vapor quality on heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop were studied. The results indicated that using flattened tubes increases the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop. However, at low mass velocities, flattening does not have a significant effect on the heat transfer coefficient. Based on the results, two correlations were proposed to predict the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop in flattened tubes by modifying the existing correlations in the literature. The performance of flattened tubes was evaluated by defining the performance evaluation criteria (PEC), considering both heat transfer enhancement and pressure drop increase at different working conditions. The highest PEC was observed for the tube with an aspect ratio of 4 at the mass velocity of 380 kg m−2 s−1",
